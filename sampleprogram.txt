-- Assumptions of language
In my interpretation of the language I made the following assumptions:

That when moving a variable to a varible, you were moving the variable value.
This meant even if the capacity of a variable was bigger than the other as long
as its value fitter the capacity it will not result in an error.

When moving a variable, the variable being moved should have a value.
If the variable has a null value, an error will arise.

When adding two variables, neither may have a null value.
This includes adding an integer to a variable, the variable value must be 
already defined at this point.
